Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning algorithms
October 2020
1 Introduction
Based on the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, heart disease is the leading cause of death for men, women, and people of most racial and ethnic groups in the United States. One person dies every 36 seconds in the United States from cardiovascular disease. About 655,000 Americans die from heart disease each year, that’s 1 in every 4 deaths. Heart disease costs the United States about $219 billion each year from 2014 to 2015. This includes the cost of health care services, medicines, and lost productivity due to death.
This makes heart disease a major concern to be dealt with. But it is difficult to identify heart disease because of several risks factors such as age, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and many other. This is the reason researchers have turn their attention to new methods to model these kinds of problems like Ma- chine Learning algorithms.
Machine learning(ML) model predictions allow businesses to make highly accu- rate guesses as to the likely outcomes of a question based on historical data. There are multiple heart datasets available on Internet. For this project I have selected the Clevelant Heart Disease dataset[3] since it is the most refined and there is a wide range of results posted online which can be used to compare against the output of this project.
The purpose of this project is to explore the existing papers related to solve heart disease prediction problem and to experiment with the top most efficient ML algorithms in search of improvement opportunities. Compare those algo- rithms and provide an insight of the accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency towards this problem.

Implementation
After the research is done, the information collected would serve as a guide of what ML algorithms and techniques to implement and experiment with. In this phase, the motivation is to try a variation of techniques, parameters or combinations to pursuit improvement in the existing algorithms accuracy and sensitivity.
Estimated completion date is Nov, 10 2020.
Analyze and Report
In the last phase, the results of the experiment will be analyzed: a detailed comparison of the algorithms implemented to show their effectiveness and de- rive their properties.
Estimated completion date is Nov 18, 2020.
